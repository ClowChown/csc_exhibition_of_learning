#Teacher Profiles on About Us Page

To upload a new teacher profile, first upload two images to the GitHub repository, titled [first_name]_headshot and [first_name]_fun. 

On the about.ejs and about.css files, there are templates included for adding future teacher profiles. 

Fill in the spaces in [brackets] with the necessary information, including First and Last name, and a brief bio. 

Replace the div with class "expanded_image" with a <img> with the 
src linked to the "fun" image on the repository. Then in the CSS file, all you have to do is paste the image url for 
the "headshot" on the repository and change the selector to .[first name], or however you set the class in the about.ejs file.
